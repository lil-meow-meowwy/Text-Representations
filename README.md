# Text Representations

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`text_representations.ipynb`) that explores different text representation techniques such as Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, and Word2Vec (Skip-Gram and CBOW) for text classification. The dataset used is a medical text dataset for cancer document classification.

## Dataset: Medical Text Dataset -Cancer Doc Classification (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/falgunipatel19/biomedical-text-publication-classification).

## Results
- **BoW Accuracy**: 93.20%
- **TF-IDF Accuracy**: 92.54%
- **Word2Vec Skip-Gram Accuracy**: 100%
- **Word2Vec CBOW Accuracy**: 100%

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `gensim`

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
